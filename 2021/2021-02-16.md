Attending: Will, Frances, Petr, David, June, Jean-Marie, Wilma, Dominik, Josh, Sebastien, Melissa, Kevin, Emil, Chris, Jason, Erin, Andreas

Start: 2:00 pm UK

## Accepting minutes from [<u>last meeting</u>](https://github.com/ome/meeting-minutes)

## Project Status

(2-3 minutes each)

- IDR:
  - Released prod93 on thursday with 3 studies.
  - idr0093 problems - need to remove screen while working on a fix
    - Deleting plate by plate
    - Short downtime, then back up on Thursday.
    - Announce on twitter etc.
    - Jason: we need to be able to handle these cases in our workflow
    - Seb: if we have 1 release per study, submitters could review first, possible to revert
    - But not practicable on our current scale
    - Frances: this was a new BF reader. Not a common occurence
    - Melissa: reader fix nearly done

- NGFF
  - 2D Benchmark shaping up, see https://github.com/ome/ngff-latency-benchmark/pull/15
    - Josh: 2D looking good now. Benchmarking performance graph looking good
  - 3D issues
    - Needs work
    - David: Trying to modify bf2raw to do 3D chunking while maintaining resolution
      - Imaris downsampling in Z problems with BF not recognising these as multiple resolutions (treated as series)
      - Seb: could update Imaris reader to 'do the right thing' and downsample in Z, but might not work well with OMERO etc.
      - Benchmark testing only needs to work on the lowest resolution
      - Chris: array access no different between resolutions
      - Josh: Do 3D chunking and then throw away other resolutions (series)
  - Josh: feedback on graphs appreciated
    - NB: zarr was faster than expected - nested storage was failing so blank chuncks being returned (fast)
  - NGFF community call next Tuesday. AM and PM time slots
    - Invites on image.sc like previous meetings. NO requirement. Everyone welcome
    - Will affect standup availability on Tue morning
  - AWS (Jason): Access via UoD --> JISC
      - Decision use both UoD and Glencoe AWS resources for benchmarking testing
  - Chris: future - compare AWS with Azure, Google cloud etc?

- Releases
  - preparing insight 5.5.16 (bugs) (ready to go)
  - iviewer 0.10.2 (probably tomorrow)
  - finalising figure
  - web later
